We shall build a component to deliver the podinfo application, which we will then deploy using OCM&amp;rsquo;s Flux integration. Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate some of the useful features of OCM.

A component version consists of a set of technical artifacts, e.g. Docker images, Helm charts, binaries, configuration data etc. Such artifacts are called resources in this specification. Resources are usually built from something, e.g. code in a git repo.</description></item><item><title>Input and Access Types</title><link>https://ocm.software/docs/guides/input_and_access/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2023 08:24:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ocm.software/docs/guides/input_and_access/</guid><description>Input and Access Types Usage: Input Types binary dir docker dockermulti file helm ociImage spiff utf-8 Access Types git localBlob ociArtifact ociBlob s3 Input and Access Types # The Open Component Model spec supports multiple methods how to add resources to a component version. There are two different ways how to add content: Input Type and Access Type
An Input type adds content along with the component descriptor and stores it in the same target repository where the component is store.</description></item><item><title>Best Practices</title><link>https://ocm.software/docs/guides/best-practices-with-ocm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 12:00:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ocm.software/docs/guides/best-practices-with-ocm/</guid><description>This chapter contains guidelines for common scenarios how to work with the Open Component Model.
